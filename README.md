# Database-Normalization
## DBS Project - Module 1

This project is done as a part of my **Database Systems course**.
It deals with the Normalization (Finding the current Normal form(s) it satisfies and decomposing into higher normal form(s) )
The whole application is coded in java and has a Java Swing GUI.

### To run the application:
```
javac -d build/classes -cp build/classes src/module1/*.java
java -cp build/classes module1.Front
```
